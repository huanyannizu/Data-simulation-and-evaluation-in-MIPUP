#### To simulate data, run command:
>python Data_Simulation.py repSaveData n_clone n_mutation cell_size_min cell_size_max n_sample read_cov d

#### Parameters in the above command:
- repSaveData: the directory to save the simulated data
- n_clone: the number of clones(nodes) in a simulated tree
- n_mutation: the number of mutations in a simulated tree
- cell_size_min: minimum cell population size in a simulated tree
- cell_size_max: maxmum cell population size in a simulated tree
- n_sample: the number of samples taken from a simulated tree
- read_cov: read coverage used when sampling from a simulated tree
- d: the number of nodes to remove mutations from
